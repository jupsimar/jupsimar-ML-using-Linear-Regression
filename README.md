# Showing following concept :
# K-means clustering and vector quantization
The k-means algorithm takes as input the number of clusters to generate, k, and a set of observation vectors to cluster. It returns a set of centroids, one for each of the k clusters. An observation vector is classified with the cluster number or centroid index of the centroid closest to it.
# The K Means Algorithm
Choose a Number of Clusters ‘K’
Randomly assign each point to a cluster (the cluster centroid is computed by taking the mean vector of points in the cluster)
